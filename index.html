    <h1>The Ghost Gang</h1>
    <p>The Ghost Gang refers to the original antagonists of the first Pac-Man game, who return in most of the other
        games in the Pac-Man series. The group is comprised of four ghosts named Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.</p>

    <h2 class="blinky">Blinky</h2>
    <p class="blinky">The red ghost is bad-tempered, crude, bossy, bully, fast, bratty, grouchy, dangerous, mean,
        sarcastic, greedy, and mostly aggressive. He's the responsible leader of the four and the arch-nemesis of
        Pac-Man.</p>

    <h2>Inky</h2>
    <p>The cyan or blue ghost who is goofy, shy, unpredictable, wacky, shattered-brained, a little reckless, dizzy, and
        can also sometimes chase Pac-Man aggressively like Blinky.</p>

    <h2>Pinky</h2>
    <p>The pink ghost who is mischievous, persistent, tricky, cute, adorable, beautiful, happy, lovely, and has a big
        crush on Pac-Man from time to time. In the original arcade game, she's the only female ghost.</p>

    <img src="clyde.png" alt="An orange ghost">
    <h2>Clyde</h2>
    <p>The orange ghost who is cowardly, lazy, stupid, brainless, hopeless, and seemingly dumb, but may just be smarter
        than he lets on and doesn't really care about chasing Pac-Man. He always distracts himself.</p>
